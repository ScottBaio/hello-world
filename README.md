# hello-world
This is my first repository. I am an old dog trying to teach itself new tricks.

I have a lot of ideas I would like to execute. I am tired of just thinking about them and would like to start doing something about them.

I hope that learning how to use GitHub and a programming language will be just the catalyst I need to realize that goal.

I really just want to make the things that I think about that could be really helpful to individuals.
